 [Higher education created distance with my family—but our love endures | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/higher-education-created-distance-my-family-our-love-endures)

“When will you stop studying and get married and have children?” My parents have been asking me that question for years. I grew up in a small city in Brazil, in a family where education—especially for women—was not a priority. Neither of my parents finished secondary school; my dad is a truck driver and my mom works as a hotel cleaner and housekeeper. The day I told my mom I got a job offer to do a postdoc in the United States, she said, “Don’t forget the man is the leader of the house.” I love my family, and they love me. But my education has given me different dreams and created distance between us that we are trying to bridge.
>"你什么时候可以停止你的学业，然后结婚生子？"我父母多年来一直在问我这个问题。我省与巴西一个小城市，在我的家庭，教育对于女性来说不是被优先考虑的。我父母都都没有读完中学，我父亲是一个卡车四级，我妈妈酒店保洁和管家。一天，我告诉我的母亲我获得了去美国念博士的Offer，她说"别忘了这个男人是家里的领导者"，我爱我的家，同时他们也爱我，但是教育给了我不同的梦想同时也尝试弥补我们之间的差距

My grandmother helped spark my education and career ambitions by teaching me to buy and exchange books at secondhand bookshops. Books ignited a hunger to learn about the world around me and become a scientist. Throughout my bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and doctorate, I was told that was not an option. Professors and peers said my family background and the poor public schools I had attended put my dream of becoming a researcher out of reach. But I was addicted to learning and wouldn’t give up. Thankfully I also had incredible mentors who supported me, and access to programs intended to help students like me succeed.
>我的祖母激发我教育和职业的雄心，通过教我购买和交换二手书。书本点燃了我的我了解世界和成为一名科学家的热火。在我的学士、硕士和博士期间，我被告知这不是唯一的选择。教授和同行说，我的家庭背景和我上的贫穷的公立学校无法支撑我完成研究人员的梦想。但是我沉迷学习，我决不放弃。幸运的是，我有令人难以置信的倒是支持我，并有机会参加帮助像我一样的学生去获得成功。


I had expected the academic hurdles. But I was caught off-guard by the challenges within my family. I felt increasingly distant from them, starting during my bachelor’s degree. My parents don’t understand academic challenges and rewards—why it takes so long to write and publish my research, why I persist in studying despite many years of poor salary, the happiness of getting a manuscript accepted or getting an award, especially when no money is involved. I can’t discuss politics, race, or gender with them without fighting, and whenever I feel sad they still advise me to get married.
>我早就预料到了在学术上的障碍，但是我被我家庭内部的挑战打了个措手不及。从我的学士生涯开始，我就感觉我已经离他们越来越远。我的父母无法理解学术上的挑战和回报---例如我为什么话那么多时间去写论文和发表我的研究，为什么我不顾底薪坚持学习，手稿被接收或者是获奖的快乐，特别是这都是无偿的。我无法跟他们就比赛和政治或者是种族、性别去进行争吵，每当我难过的时候，他们就建议我结婚
