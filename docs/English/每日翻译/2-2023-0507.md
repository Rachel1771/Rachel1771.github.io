#### Editor’s summary
>Galaxies accrete gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium and then turn this gas into stars. Feedback processes such as supernova explosions enrich the gas with elements heavier than helium and can impart enough momentum to eject some gas out of the galaxy. S. Zhang _et al_. observed the intergalactic medium around a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3. In addition to emission lines caused by hydrogen and helium, they observed lines for carbon, indicating that the gas has been enriched with heavier elements. The kinematics are consistent with streams of gas spiraling toward the massive galaxy. The authors propose that the enriched gas has been recycled from an earlier period of star formation. —Keith T.

#### 1.编者总结
>星系从周围的星系介质中吸收气体。类似超新星爆炸之类的反馈的过程使得气体富含比氦更重的元素，并且可以赋予足够的动量将一些气体喷射出星系。张淑贤等人在红移2.3处观测到大质量星系周围的星系介质。除了由氢氦引起的射线外，他们还观测到了碳射线，这表明了涉县中有更重的元素。运动轨迹和大质量星系的气体螺旋上升的轨迹一致。作者提出 ，富集气体是来自于早期恒星形成阶段回收的。

#### Abstract
>Stars form in galaxies, from gas that has been accreted from the intergalactic medium. Simulations have shown that recycling of gas—the reaccretion of gas that was previously ejected from a galaxy—could sustain star formation in the early Universe. We observe the gas surrounding a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3 and detect emission lines from neutral hydrogen, helium, and ionized carbon that extend 100 kiloparsecs from the galaxy. The kinematics of this circumgalactic gas is consistent with an inspiraling stream. The carbon abundance indicates that the gas had already been enriched with elements heavier than helium, previously ejected from a galaxy. We interpret the results as evidence of gas recycling during high-redshift galaxy assembly.

>恒星在星系中形成，由从星系介质吸收积累的气体而组成。模拟表明，气体的回收(先前从星系中喷射的气体的重新吸积) ，可以维持早期宇宙中的恒星形成。我们在红移2.3处观察一个大质量星系周围的气体，并探测到中性氢，氦和电离碳的发射线，这些发射线从星系延伸100千秒差距。
>这种环星系气体的运动规律和螺旋流一致。碳的高含量辨明了这些气体中已经包含了比氢还重的元素。我们解释为这为高红移星系形成过程中气体回收的证据。
