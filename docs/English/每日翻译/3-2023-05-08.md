“Cool as a cucumber” might be better phrased as “cool as a mushroom.” A research team has found that mushrooms and other fungi, including yeast and molds, stay cooler than their surroundings—and has also explained how they stay so chill. The contain a lot of water—just think how mushrooms shrink when cooked—and gradually release it in a fungal form of sweating that lowers their temperature, the microbiologists report this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
>像黄瓜一样酷，更适合用来表示像蘑菇一样酷。一个研究团队发现，蘑菇和其他真菌，包括酵母菌和灭菌，都比他们的环境更加凉爽，别切解释了为什么凉爽的原因。这是因为含有大量的水分，思考一下蘑菇在被煮熟的时候是如何收缩的，并逐渐以真菌形式的出汗来降低他们的温度，来自微生物学家本周在《美国国家科学院院刊》的报道

“It’s kind of a neat finding,” says Christopher Still, an ecophysiologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the work. Mostly for fun, the team even built a picnic cooler powered by mushrooms.

Walking in the woods during the COVID-19 pandemic, Johns Hopkins University microbiologist Radamés Cordero was trying out his lab’s new thermal camera, which records infrared—heat—as images. He and his colleague Arturo Casadevall planned to use the camera to see how the dark pigments of some fungi influence their surface temperature. During his hikes, Cordero imaged about 20 kinds of wild mushrooms, and all—regardless of color—were cooler than their surroundings.

Following up in the lab, the researchers found that some species, such as the brown American star-footed amanita, were just 1°C or 2°C cooler than their surroundings, but the oyster mushroom _Pleurotus ostreatus_ was almost 6°C [cooler](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2221996120). Moreover, 19 kinds of molds and yeast, including Brewer’s yeast, the mold that makes penicillin, and a few human pathogens, were also cool, particularly near the center of their colonies. Even at air temperatures close to freezing, the colonies were about 1°C colder.
