### Abstract

Digital information, when converted into a DNA sequence, provides dense, stable, energy-efficient, and sustainable data storage. The most stable method for encapsulating DNA has been in an inorganic matrix of silica, iron oxide, or both, but are limited by low DNA uptake and complex recovery techniques. This study investigated a rationally designed thermally responsive functionally graded (TRFG) hydrogel as a simple and cost-effective method for storing DNA. The TRFG hydrogel shows high DNA uptake, long-term protection, and reusability due to nondestructive DNA extraction. The high loading capacity was achieved by directly absorbing DNA from the solution, which is then retained because of its interaction with a hyperbranched cationic polymer loaded into a negatively charged hydrogel matrix used as a support and because of its thermoresponsive nature, **which allows DNA concentration within the hydrogel through multiple swelling/deswelling cycles.** We were able to achieve a high DNA data density of 7.0 × 109 gigabytes per gram using a hydrogel-based system.

### INTRODUCTION

In today’s digital information age, the global demand for data storage is growing at an exponential rate ([_1_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R1)–[_3_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R3)). However, further reduction of traditional storage architectures, such as hard drives and magnetic tapes, is a growing challenge ([_4_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R4), [_5_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R5)). Current devices have reached their physical limits and can hardly maintain pace with the ever-increasing digital storage requirements. These issues might be resolved by DNA data storage, which is an emerging technology that provides substantial DNA density ([_5_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R5)–[_8_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R8)) with a remarkable half-life ([_9_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R9), [_10_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R10)).

DNA storage is based on encoding data into DNA molecules expressed as a four-letter code, i.e., A, T, C, and G. On the basis of prior calculations, DNA can theoretically store up to 455 EB/g (4.55 × 1011 GB/g), which are 10 billion times higher than the traditional storage media (100 GB/g) ([_11_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R11), [_12_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R12)). However, there are several hurdles that need to be overcome before approaching this theoretical storage density. At present, DNA powder is commonly used for DNA data storage, but this approach has the following limitations: First, the DNA powder needs to be associated with other DNA protective carriers, such as silica beads, to avoid contamination and loss. However, the carrier tends to have a much higher weight than the DNA itself, which reduces the effective DNA storage capacity (DNA weight/total weight). Second, this method is prone to DNA damage and contamination. Third, DNA may require coexistence with numerous DNA stabilizers, such as trehalose and polyvinyl alcohol, to enhance its storage life, which also reduces the effective DNA storage capacity ([_13_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R13)–[_16_](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9933#core-R16)). Furthermore, DNA powder may not mix well with the DNA stabilizer. Therefore, it is important to explore other methods that can improve the DNA loading efficiency during the preservation process.
