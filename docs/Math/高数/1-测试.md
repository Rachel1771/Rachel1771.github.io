Math is the superpower for deep learning researchers.

简单的测试一下是否成功!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
One of the wonderful parts of modern deep learning is the fact that much of it `can be understood and used without a full understanding of the mathematics below it`. This is a sign that the field is maturing. Just as most software developers no longer need to worry about the theory of computable functions, neither should deep learning practitioners need to worry about the theoretical foundations of maximum likelihood learning.

But, we are not quite there yet.
我们将小机器人的位置状态用$\hat{x}_k$ （postion和velocity）来表示：
$$
\overrightarrow{x_{k}}=(\vec{p}, \vec{v})
$$

In practice, you will sometimes `need to understand how architectural choices influence gradient flow or the implicit assumptions you make by training with a certain loss function.` You might need to know what in the world entropy measures, and how it can help you `understand exactly what bits-per-character means in your model`. These all require deeper mathematical understanding.
